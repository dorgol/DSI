The document "KellogAuthorList_needs_cleaning.csv" [NOW REMOVED SINCE THIS TASK IS DONE] contains her list of papers as pulled from google scholar. 

Done :

1. About twenty papers are missing a year and a few more have a year in the  early 1900's, well before her years of active work. 
    - Fill in the year for the papers missing years, unless it's a  duplicate of a paper someowhere else in the list, in which case write "duplicate" (or some other keyword so I can filter later) in the year column.
    - Check that the papers from years like 1914 should truly be remove and if so write "remove" in the year column. 
    This will probably involve a lot of googling of paper titles : /
    - **When you're done with your part, save a version with your initials in the title.** 
    
2.  (For Lorraine) clean authors names, joining authors who are listed under different names
-   Use the file "KellogAuthorList_needs_author_cleaning.csv"
-   When you're done with your part, save a version with your initials in the title.
