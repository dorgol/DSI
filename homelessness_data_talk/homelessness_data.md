How Trustworthy Is Data About People Experiencing Homelessness? A Los Angeles Case Study
========================================================
author: Jane Carlen
date: October 15, 2018

<!-- Overview: Iâ€™ll discuss various aspects of data about homeless people from collection to media reporting. This will touch on the importance of data skepticism and how to use statistical knowledge both basic and advanced to get the most out of data.

#0. Introduction and my background: My first statistical project was as a summer intern in college, trying to count the number of chronically homeless people in midtown Manhattan. I was wildly under-qualified for the job, but it helped me understand the challenges surrounding data about homeless people. (5min)

#1. The annual count: How the number is produced and the decisions and approximations taken to get there. Stress the importance of dissecting widely reported numbers and not just trusting them. Discuss year-to-year changes. (20 min)

#2. An example (overview, not getting into too many technical details) of applying more advanced statistical methods to answer the question of how many people experience homelessness in LA over the course of a year, not just on a single night. (10 min)

#3. Social inequality reflected in data and using statistical training to hold organizations accountable. Discuss the data dive we did in LA/SF with DataKind around homelessness in LA. (5 min)-->

There are 53,195 homeless people in LA
